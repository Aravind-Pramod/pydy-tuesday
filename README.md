Pydy Tuesday Tuesday

Welcome to the **Pydy Tuesday** repository! This is a personal project where I work on weekly Tidy Tuesday datasets using Python to improve my skills in:

- Data analysis
- Data visualization
- Machine learning

## About Tidy Tuesday

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly data project aimed at practicing data wrangling and visualization. Each week, a new dataset is shared, providing an opportunity to explore, analyze, and create visualizations.

## Goals

1. Enhance Python data analysis skills.
2. Create insightful and visually appealing visualizations.
3. Experiment with machine learning techniques on real-world datasets.
